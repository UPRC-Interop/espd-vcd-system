    <entry key="espd.init.alert">European Single Procurement Document (ESPD) is a self-declaration of the businesses' financial status, abilities and suitability for a public procurement procedure. It is available in all EU languages and used as a preliminary evidence of fulfilment of the conditions required in public procurement procedures across the EU. Thanks to the ESPD, the tenderers no longer have to provide full documentary evidence and different forms previously used in the EU procurement, which means a significant simplification of access to cross-border tendering opportunities. From October 2018 onwards the ESPD shall be provided exclusively in an electronic form. The European Commission provides a free web service for the buyers, bidders and other parties interested in filling in the ESPD electronically. The online form can be filled in, printed and then sent to the buyer together with the rest of the bid. If the procedure is run electronically, the ESPD can be exported, stored and submitted electronically. The ESPD provided in a previous public procurement procedure can be reused as long as the information remains correct. Bidders may be excluded from the procedure or be subject to prosecution if the information in the ESPD is seriously misrepresented, withheld or cannot be complemented with supporting documents.</entry>

The advantage of using the eESPD as a XML file is that buyers and companies can reuse it for other procedures in the future. It should be sent together with the procurement documents (from authority to companies) or as part of the bid (company to authority).Chr(92)Chr(92)rChr(92)nChr(92)rChr(92)nespd.PDF: The PDF file is a human readable file of the eESPD.
