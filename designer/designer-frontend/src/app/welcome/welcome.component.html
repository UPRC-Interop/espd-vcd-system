    European Single Procurement Document (ESPD) is a self-declaration of the businesses' financial status, abilities and
    suitability for a public procurement procedure. It is available in all EU languages and used as a preliminary
    evidence of fulfilment of the conditions required in public procurement procedures across the EU. Thanks to the
    ESPD, the tenderers no longer have to provide full documentary evidence and different forms previously used in the
    EU procurement, which means a significant simplification of access to cross-border tendering opportunities. From
    October 2018 onwards the ESPD shall be provided exclusively in an electronic form.
    The European Commission provides a free web service for the buyers, bidders and other parties interested in filling
    in the ESPD electronically. The online form can be filled in, printed and then sent to the buyer together with the
    rest of the bid. If the procedure is run electronically, the ESPD can be exported, stored and submitted
    electronically. The ESPD provided in a previous public procurement procedure can be reused as long as the
    information remains correct. Bidders may be excluded from the procedure or be subject to prosecution if the
    information in the ESPD is seriously misrepresented, withheld or cannot be complemented with supporting documents.
